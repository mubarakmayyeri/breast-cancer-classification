# Breast Cancer Classification: Project Overview 
* Created a machine learning model that classifies whether breast cancer is Malignant or Benign.
* Analyzed dataset with 569 observations and 33 columns
* Processed the data for making it suitable of better machine learning
* Optimized Logistic, and Random Forest Regressors using RandomSearchCV and cross validation to reach the best model. 
* Made a sample prediction for a given observation

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.10.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn 

## Dataset Information
Dataset contains 32 features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## EDA
Used count plot for finding out whether the given dataset is balanced. I looked at the distributions of the features and analyzed correlation of the variables for finding out multicollinearity.
 Below are a few highlights from exploratory data analysis.

## Data Cleaning
After collecting the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes to the variables:

*	Removed unnecessary columns
*	Encoded categorical variables
*	Removed features with multicollinearity 
*	Extracted features and target 
*	Standardized the dataset


## Model Building 

First I split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.   

I tried two different models and evaluated them using Accuracy score. Fine tuned model with best accuracy for better machine learning process. 

Machine Learning models:
*	**Logistic Regression** – chose this model because our problem is binary classification
*	**Random Forest** –  with default parameters

## Model performance
The Logistic regression model outperformed the Random forest model on the test and validation sets. 
*	**Random Forest** : Accuracy = 94.73 %
*	**Linear Regression**: Accuracy = 92.98 %

Chose **Logistic regression as final model** this problem and fine tuned its hyperparameters.
*   **Tuned Logistic regression** : Accuracy = 94.73 %, Precision = 91.48 %, Recall = 95.55 %, F1 Score = 93.47 %

Final model gave same accuracy as the model with default parameters, while precision score was little lower the recall and f1 score improved.
The model made 108 correct predictions and 6 wrong predictions on the test data.

## Sample Prediction
I made a sample prediction with the Tuned Logistic regression model with the given features:  

radius_mean = 11.13, texture_mean = 16.62, smoothness_mean = 0.08151, compactness_mean = 0.03834, symmetry_mean = 0.1511, fractal_dimension_mean = 0.06148, radius_se = 0.1415, texture_se = 0.9671, smoothness_se = 0.005883, compactness_se = 0.006263, concave points_se = 0.006189, symmetry_se = 0.02009, symmetry_worst = 0.2383

The machine learning model predicted that the cancer with given observations is **Benign**
